# jamstart
A simple node.js Express server that, when POST'ed to, calls a Powershell script that opens one of the links listed in songs.txt. The current implementation only allows this script to be called once per hour.

## To use
Execute START_SERVER.bat. I included a distribution of ngrok to facilitate public hosting.
